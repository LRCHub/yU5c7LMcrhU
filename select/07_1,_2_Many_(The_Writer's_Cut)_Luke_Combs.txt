Well I got a call from Riley 'round six o'clock
Sayin' he caught a hanker for a honkey tonk
Wants an ice-cold beer and a country song
But he didn't want to stay out all night long
Well, I ain't the kind to let a buddy drink alone
But I can't turn it off once I turn it on
There's no stopping me once I get goin'
Put a can in my hand, man I'm wide ass open
The ticktock of that clock is like a time bomb
By half past ten, I'm half past tipsy
At quarter to 12, man I've done had plenty
The countdown's on when the first beer hit me
Five, four, three, two, one, too many
After five diet Millers I was feelin' loose
Singin' karaoke to a TL tune
When a pretty little thing shot me a wink
She said, "Hey cowboy, could you buy us a drink?"
Well hey, baby doll, I will if you want
But I can't turn it off once I turn it on
There's no stoppin' me once I get goin'
Put a can in my hand, man I'm wide ass open
The ticktock of that clock is like a time bomb
By half past ten, I'm half past tipsy
At quarter to 12, man I've done had plenty
The countdown's on when the first beer hit me
Five, four, three, two, one, too many
Now I've never been the kind to quit
Won't stop 'til I get to the bottom of this
And the night's still young
So what you say we shotgun one?
There's no stoppin' me once I get goin'
Put a can in my hand, man I'm wide ass open
The ticktock of that clock is like a time bomb
By half past ten, I'm half past tipsy
At quarter to 12, man I've done had plenty
The countdown's on when the first beer hit me
Five, four, three, two, one, too many
Yeah, five, four, three, two, one, too many
