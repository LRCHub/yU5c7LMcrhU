[00:17.37] The Chairman's portrait looks out
[00:20.14] As horses in gas masks speak bitterness
[00:23.41] And fall upwards during earthquake drills
[00:28.27] Struggle is in session
[00:30.91] And struggle sessions leave us demons
[00:33.92] Standing on stools under nooses
[00:37.04] Reading aloud their repentance
[00:38.84] From blackboards cracked from being looted
[00:42.62] From the University of Heaven, Heaven, Heaven, Heaven
